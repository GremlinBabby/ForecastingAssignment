# ForecastingAssignment
A small assignment example I worked on.

A method is empty due to the database needed being imaginary, the explanation for the logic behind it was explained
in the document I sent off for the assignment.

The setForecastInfo() method is meant to retrieve the sales and forecasting data for a particular product a week earlier in the database.
